Output Prediction System 📊
An end-to-end Machine Learning solution designed to analyze historical data patterns and predict future output values using supervised learning. This system aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize decision-making processes.

🚀 Overview
This project focuses on the implementation of a predictive pipeline—from data preprocessing to model evaluation. By leveraging historical datasets, the system learns the relationship between various input features and a target output, allowing it to generalize and predict outcomes for unseen data.
